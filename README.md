## About EOSIO Labs

EOSIO Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use EOSIO Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications. Community members are also welcome to contribute and further develop these repositories. Since these repositories are not supported by Block.one, we may not provide responses to issue reports, pull requests, updates to functionality, or other requests from the community, and we encourage the community to take responsibility for these.

## Requirements

* Android SDK 6.0+
* Android Studio 3.0+
* JDK 1.7

## Installation

To get the example application up and running:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-example-app.git`
1. Open the project with Android Studio.
1. Create `gradle.properties` file:

    ```java
    node_url=your node endpoint URL //mandatory
    from_account = your account //optional
    to_account = receiver account //optional
    from_account_private_key = your private key //optional
    amount = amount to transfer //optional
    memo = transaction's memo //optional
    ```
    **node_url** is mandatory for the app to point to a specific endpoint. 
    
    **from_account**, **to_account**, **from_account_private_key**, **amount** and **memo** are optional fields which will be filled to the app's form for quickly making transaction. 
1. Run the App.

## About the App

The app demonstrates how to: 
- Use [Rpc provider implementation](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-rpc-provider) to query the chain for an account's token balance.
- Get a new Transaction from [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java).
- Create an action and add it to a transaction,
- and sign and broadcast the transaction.

To do this we are using a few libraries and providers, in concert:

* [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java): The core EOSIO SDK for Java library
* [RPC Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-rpc-provider): The RPC provider implementation in the core library
* [ABIEOS Serialization Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider): A pluggable serialization provider for EOSIO SDK for Java using ABIEOS (for transaction and action conversion between JSON and binary data representations)
* [Softkey Signature Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-softkey-signature-provider): An example pluggable signature provider for EOSIO SDK for Java for signing transactions using in-memory keys (not for production use)

The [`TransactionTask.java`](app/src/main/java/one/block/asaptestapp/TransactionTask.java) contains the sample code about how to use eosiojava libraries to send out transactions in a most basic/easiest way. Basic steps:

1. Create serialization provider as an instant of [`AbiEosSerializationProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider/blob/develop/eosiojavaabieos/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojavaabieosserializationprovider/AbiEosSerializationProviderImpl.java) from [`eosiojavaandroidabieosserializationprovider`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider) library.
1. Create RPC provider as an instant of [`EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-rpc-provider/blob/master/eosiojavarpcprovider/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojavarpcprovider/implementations/EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl.java) with an input string point to a node backend.
1. Create ABI provider as an instant of [`ABIProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/implementations/ABIProviderImpl.java) with instants of Rpc provider and serialization provider.
1. Create Signature provider as an instant of [` SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-softkey-signature-provider/blob/master/eosiojavasoftkeysignatureprovider/src/main/java/one/block/eosiosoftkeysignatureprovider/SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl.java) which is not recommended for production because of its simple key management.
    - Import an EOS private key which associate with sender's account which will be used to sign the transaction.
1. Create an instant of [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java) which is used for spawning/factory [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java)
1. Create an instant of [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java) from the instant of [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java) above by calling ` TransactionSession#getTransactionProcessor()` or `TransactionSession#getTransactionProcessor(Transaction)` if desire to use a preset [`Transaction`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/models/rpcProvider/Transaction.java) object.
1. Call `TransactionProcessor#prepare(List)` with a list of Actions which is desired to be sent to backend. The method will serialize the list of action to list of hex and keep them inside the list of `Transaction#getActions()`. The transaction now is ready to be signed and broadcast.
1. Call `TransactionProcessor#signAndBroadcast()` to sign the transaction inside [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java) and broadcast it to backend.
