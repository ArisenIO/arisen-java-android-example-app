## About EOSIO Labs

EOSIO Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use EOSIO Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications. Community members are also welcome to contribute and further develop these repositories. Since these repositories are not supported by Block.one, we may not provide responses to issue reports, pull requests, updates to functionality, or other requests from the community, and we encourage the community to take responsibility for these.

## Usage

The example app is using these below libraries to communicate with EOSIO chain: 

```java
implementation 'one.block:eosiojava:0.0.1'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavasoftkeysignatureprovider:0.0.1'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavaandroidabieosserializationprovider:0.0.1'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavarpcprovider:0.0.1'
```

There are some predefined properties need to be filled to run the app in **eosio.properties**: 

```java
node_url=your node endpoint URL //mandatory
from_account = your account //optional
to_account = receiver account //optional
from_account_private_key = your private key //optional
amount = amount to transfer //optional
memo = transaction's memo //optional
```
**node_url** is mandatory for the app to point to a specific endpoint. 

**from_account**, **to_account**, **from_account_private_key**, **amount** and **memo** are optional fields which will be filled to the app's form for quickly making transaction.

Wallets and related components are complex software that require the highest levels of security.  If incorrectly built or used, they may compromise usersâ€™ private keys and digital assets. Wallet applications and related components should undergo thorough security evaluations before being used.  Only experienced developers should work with this software.
